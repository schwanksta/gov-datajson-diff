Each record contains an entry for Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) station number, date, building number, a code representing the discipline, project number, floor, and wing. Disciplines include architectural, electrical, mechanical, structural, etc. Hard copy of the plans are stored at each VAMC. The plans are microfilmed at the National Archives and aperture cards are produced for both Contract and As-Built stages of the contract. An original copy of each aperture card is kept at the National Archives, with copies to VACO and the VAMC. The Program Planning and Management Office enters a record into PLIARS for each new card the VACO receives. They are also responsible for maintaining the database. Primary users of the PLIARS database are contractors hired to do work. In-house technical staff and the Engineering offices at the VAMC's. Users of PLIARS can request aperture cards for the buildings, disciplines, projects and medical centers as needed. Staff pull the aperture cards from the files and make either half or full size blow-ups of the drawings.</p>",

As defined by the Census Bureau, Rural encompasses all population, housing, and territory not included within an Urban area (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html).\n\nThis table contains the Veteran estimates by urban/rural, age group, poverty, and disability. The poverty level and disability are determined by ACS based on responses on total income and functional difficulties. Refer to the sections on Poverty and Disability Status in the document, https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2023_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf\n\nNote: rounding to the nearest 1,000 is always appropriate for VetPop estimates.",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.)

Even though the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention characterized the risk of transmission of CJD from blood derivative products as 'small and immeasurable' and 'theoretical', VA believed it had an ethical obligation to inform patients of the exposure to potentially contaminated blood components or plasma derivative products while under VA's care. The patients were notified. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established a tracking system for individuals who received these products to determine if there was an increase in VA CJD cases. Every two years, the VHA National Infectious Diseases Service updates the status of patients who had previously been identified through the VA CJD lookback notification initiative. The Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Lookback Dataset (CJDLD) is a prospective collection of data; requests for individual reports are not accepted.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database contains emerging pathogens information from the local Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). The EPI software package allows the VA to track emerging pathogens on the national level without additional data entry at the local level. The results from aggregation of data can be shared with the appropriate public health authorities including non-VA and the private health care sector allowing national planning, formulation of intervention strategies, and resource allocations. EPI is designed to automatically collect data on emerging diseases for Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) to analyze. The data is sent to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) from all Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) systems for initial processing and combination with related workload data. VACO data retrieval and analysis is then carried out. The AITC creates two file structures both in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) file format, which are used as a source of data for the Veterans Affairs Headquarters (VAHQ) Infectious Diseases Program Office. These files are manipulated and used for analysis and reporting by the National Infectious Diseases Service. Emerging Pathogens (as characterized by VACO) act as triggers for data acquisition activities in the automated program. The system retrieves relevant, predetermined, patient-specific information in the form of a Health Level Seven (HL7) message that is transmitted to the central data repository at the AITC. Once at that location, the data is converted to a SAS dataset for analysis by the VACO National Infectious Diseases Service. Before data transmission an Emerging Pathogens Verification Report is produced for the local sites to review, verify, and make corrections as needed. After data transmission to the AITC it is added to the EPI database.</p>",

It provides a single point of access for the clinical user's application and information needs, facilitating faster and more efficient patient care.The CISS framework further establishes a foundation for publishing any type of application, including clinical, non-clinical, HealtheVet, and legacy applications. These plug-in applications, called 'partner systems', can be developed independently and published to the users through the CISS portal. The CISS Program development team uses repeatable Agile development, management and support processes to rapidly develop quality software in 6-month release cycles, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>",

Cameron, Kathleen F. Carlson, Sonya B. Norman, and Jessica L. Hamblen. \n\nAbstract: Given the extensive research on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment, a single, updatable repository of data from PTSD treatment studies would be useful for clinical, research, and policy stakeholders. To meet this need, we established a preliminary dataset of abstracted PTSD trial data, which serve as the basis for the PTSD Trials Standardized Data Repository (PTSD-Repository), maintained by the National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD).We followed systematic review methods to identify published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PTSD interventions. We consulted with a panel of experts to determine a priori inclusion criteria, ensure that we captured all relevant studies, and identify variables for abstraction. We searched multiple databases for materials published from 1980 to 2018 and reviewed reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines. In total, 318 RCTs of PTSD interventions that enrolled almost 25,000 participants were included. We abstracted 337 variables across all studies, including study, participant, and intervention characteristics as well as results. In the present paper, we describe our methods and define data elements included in the data tables. We explain coding challenges, identify inconsistencies in reporting across study types, and discuss ways stakeholders can use PTSD-Repository data to enhance research, education, and policy. The abstracted data are currently publicly available on the NCPTSD website and can be used for future systematic reviews and identifying research gaps and as an information resource for clinicians, patients, and family members.\n\nCitation: O'Neil, M.

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) established a central database of Prosthetics data recorded at each Veterans Health Administration facility. Its objective was to enable clinical reviews to increase quality, reduce costs, and improve efficiency of the Prosthetics program. Increase the quality of the services to our Veterans by providing a means to develop consistency in services, review prescription and management practices, develop training, monitor Home Medical Equipment, and measure performance improvements. Reduce costs by comparing costs system-wide, identifying common items for consolidated contracting, identifying costs for Medical Cost Care Funds (MCCF) purposes and improving contracting cost benefit. Improve efficiency by validating the data, improving budget management, determining where coding errors occur, providing training, and comparing unique social security numbers for multiple site usage and item issue. The NPPD Menu provides patient information, patient eligibility, Prosthetic treatment, date of provision, cost, vendor, and purchasing agent information. This system tracks average cost data and its usage and provides on both a monthly and quarterly basis detailed and summary reports by station, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and agency. The NPPD Menu resides in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the medical center level. This data is updated quarterly. Data is rolled up at each facility and transmitted to Hines. The data is then loaded into the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) from which data extracts are done. The data is also put into a ProClarity cube and is available to VA local, regional, and national managers online. National managers have the ability to properly monitor, oversee and manage the national program and regional managers are able to effectively manage their respective areas using this tool. The primary purpose of this database is to provide financial and clinical oversight of the Prosthetics program and is used primarily by the Prosthetics and Sensory Aids (PSA) including VISN staff, VISN Prosthetics Representatives, Prosthetics Program Managers and other Prosthetics staff.</p>",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

DES productivity is measured using weighted work units known as relative value units (RVUs). RVU values are determined cooperatively by the Dental Coding Committee and Decision Support System (DSS) staff. One RVU is a measure of work effort and represents one minute of the average provider's time (presuming the provider is supported with one dental assistant and one treatment room) and is reported as a value with each procedure reported to DES. DES transactions are sent to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) database using standard Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging and the VA Vitria Interface Engine. These batched HL7 messages are parsed at the AITC and placed in a flat database file.</p>",

Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially-adapted housing.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

Instead, go to accesstocare.va.gov for current wait times and other relevant access data.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 21, 2014, VA launched the Accelerating Access to Care Initiative, a nation-wide program to ensure timely access to care. As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access. The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package",

            "description": "<p>VBA EDUCATION BENEFITS PROGRAM to help servicepersons adjust to civilian life after separation from military service, assist in the recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel in the active and reserve components in the Armed Forces by providing education benefits, and to provide educational opportunities to the dependents of certain service members and veterans. Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

The Non-VA Hospital System (NVH) software captures the patient's Demographics, Provider, Hospital Name and Location, Medicare Provider Number, Diagnoses and Procedures for which the patient received care during his/her inpatient stay. The data is received from either the patient or the medical center providing the care (normally on a UB-92 form). The billing office employee enters the information into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture and sends information to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The non-VA hospitals are reimbursed at Medicare rates based on the Prospective System (PPS). PPS uses the appropriate Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs). Each DRG has a different rate-adjusted reimbursement based on the regional and urban/rural designation of the provider non-VA Hospitals. NVH is housed at the AITC and uses software developed by the AITC in conjunction with 3M and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It is a batch system written in Common Business Oriented Language, ALC, and Statistical Analysis Software. Processing occurs daily.</p>",

            "description": "This report provides county-level estimates of the number of Veterans who were receiving VA Disability Compensation benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2023. It includes the Veterans\u2019 total service-connected disability (SCD) rating, age group, and sex. Blank values represent small cell counts that have been suppressed to protect the identity of Veterans as well as some cell counts that have been suppressed in order to prevent the determination of the values of the aforementioned small cell counts. Some categories may not sum to the total due to missing information (e.g., age, sex, etc.).\n\nThe availability of sex and age data is limited as some records have no sex or birthdate available. In the table, there are 404 Veterans whose sex is not available and 113 Veterans whose age is not available.\n\nThe number of Veterans who were disability compensation recipients during FY 2023 but were no longer disability compensation recipients at the end of FY 2023 is 138,646.  These Veterans are not included in the table.\n\nSource: Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Enterprise Integration, Veteran Object FY23 data and Veterans Benefits Administration VETSNET FY 2023 compensation data.\n\nPrepared by National Center for Veterans Analysis & Statistics, www.va.gov/vetdata.",

            "description": "<p>The Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System (DEMPS) is the Veterans Health Administrations main deployment program for clinical and non-clinical staff to an emergency or disaster. The DEMPS Program may be used for an internal VA mission, as well as supporting a mission after a Presidential Disaster Declaration under the National Response Frameworks Emergency Support Function #8 (Public Health and Medical Services). Interested, qualified VHA staff can apply online by submitting a DEMPS Application. DEMPS Coordinators and Administrators can manage volunteer data by accessing DEMPS Administration.The DEMPS Program is made up of the following entities:The DEMPS Volunteers (Full-time VHA employee, or Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps Volunteer (ERC)) VAMC DEMPS Coordinator DEMPS VAMC Facility Support Staff (Fiscal, Payroll, and Travel) DEMPS VISN Points of Contact DEMPS National Program Manager VHA Office of Emergency Management staff (Area Emergency Managers, and Regional Emergency Managers) Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, and The DEMPS database. In order for DEMPS to work successfully, all eight entities above must work together to deploy the DEMPS Volunteer to an emergency or disaster site.The DEMPS database was developed to collect specific information on full-time VHA medical personnel (clinical and non-clinical) and Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps (ERC) Volunteers who have volunteered and been approved by their Medical Center Director to be deployed (full-time staff or ERC Volunteers) in the event of a disaster, or to back fill a medical center (ERC Volunteers). When disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, etc., occur and the state and local resources to handle the response/recovery process are overwhelmed, the state in which the disaster occurs may request federal assistance. In this case, a Presidential Disaster Declaration is issued and the National Response Framework (NRF) is activated. Once the damage to the area and needs have been assessed, and it is determined that medical resources are required, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may task VA to provide these resources. Generally, these requests are for medical personnel (nurses, physicians, pharmacists, etc.), pharmaceutical (or other medical) supplies, and medical equipment. However, depending on the mission, VHA may deploy non-clinical staff to support the infrastructure of the deployment.</p>",

All known information is proved as part of this data set.</b></p>\n<p>The National Cardiac Device Surveillance Program Database supports the Eastern Pacemaker Surveillance Center (EPSC) staff in its function of monitoring some 11,000 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients who have implanted pacemakers or cardioverters. The database stores medically useful information about the patients and their pacemaker test results in order to highlight serial changes, which determine whether the pacemaker is still functioning normally, or whether the patient requires further intervention. The EPSC staff performs regular telephonic checkups, in conjunction with less frequent in-hospital clinic checkups, to determine when pacemakers need to be replaced. Patients are scheduled and called by the Pacemaker Surveillance Center, and have their electrocardiogram recorded and analyzed over the phone, using wires attached to their fingers and a VHA-supplied transmitter.  Additionally, some patients are monitored via web-based downloads of their device telemetry.  The Pacemaker Center also provides in-hospital clinic checkups for local Washington DC VHA pacemaker patients. All information obtained during the checkups is recorded in the EPSC Database. The database also contains records of pacemaker patients being monitored by VHA facilities east of the Mississippi and who are not being monitored directly by their respective VA medical centers. The VHA Department of Medical Services encourages local VHA medical centers to refer their patients for pacemaker follow-up monitoring to either the Eastern Surveillance Center or to the counterpart Western Surveillance Center in San Francisco, whichever is geographically appropriate. However, referral is optional. The database also maintains a registry of all VHA patients, living and deceased, who have had pacemakers implanted at, or who have been monitored by, VHA facilities. The EPSC receives information for the registry directly from the medical centers for patients that it does not monitor, totaling over 80,000 as of 2010.</p>",

Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.)

Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: \u2022 a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; \u2022 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or \u2022 for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

POWER leverages a data warehouse to maintain data used in VHA performance measure calculations. The site provides Web-based analytical reporting capabilities, allowing users to view data by dimensions, such as, National, Consolidated Patient Account Center (CPAC), Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), or Station locations and by month. The data can also be displayed in tables, graphs and spreadsheets. It should be noted that POWER is not an accounting system; rather, it is a strategic and operational performance reporting system.The POWER system supports VHA's efforts to improve its revenue business operations by providing accurate and reliable performance information on the following metrics: Collections, Gross Days Revenue Outstanding (GDRO), Percentage of Accounts Receivable (AR) Greater than 90 Days, Days to Bill, Total Billings, Percentage of Collections to Billings, and Cost to Collect. POWER is VHA's revenue performance metric dashboard monitoring system that tracks MCCF performance by National, CPAC, VISN and Station.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The VA National Clozapine Registry tracks the health and demographics of patients who have been prescribed clozapine by the VA. Clozapine, or the brand name Clozaril, is a drug used to treat the most serious cases of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, clozapine may also affect portions of the blood, lowering the body's resistance to infection and sometimes creating life-threatening circumstances. Realizing the severity of the problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines for analysis of White Blood Cells and Neutrophils and set strict minimum limits. The FDA also mandated that any manufacturer of clozapine must maintain a Clozapine Registry. These registries are to track the location and the health of clozapine patients and to ensure 'weekly White Blood Cell testing prior to delivery of the next week's supply of medication'. To date, the clozapine manufacturer registries have been unable to develop sufficient controls to meet these requirements, especially the ability to prevent dispensing clozapine when blood results are abnormal. However, because of the unique structure of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Veterans Health Administration obtained permission from the FDA and clozapine manufacturers to use its in-place computer network to gather and evaluate weekly patient information, then export this data to manufacturer clozapine registries. The VA assigned functional administration of this effort to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in Dallas, Texas. Weekly data on each VA clozapine patient is processed at two locations. Facility Level --When a clozapine prescription is written, a computer program in each facility's internal computer system retrieves white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and clozapine dose and evaluates the information according to FDA guidelines. If an adverse blood condition is found, the computer may warn to trigger a physician reevaluation, or lock out entirely to prevent dispensing, depending on the severity. Weekly, this information, along with certain patient demographic information, is gathered locally and transmitted to Hines Office of Information &amp; Technology Field Office for centralized storage. This data can only be accessed by the NCCC. Raw data is downloaded from the Hines OI Field Office database on a weekly basis. An ancillary computer program reformats the data and evaluates the information for inconsistencies and data gathering errors. The computer-corrected data is manually compared with hand-written facsimile information sent to the NCCC by each site. This manually corrected data is again reformatted for data storage in MS Access format at the NCCC. The corrected data is also reformatted into American Standard Code for Information Interchange fixed-length fields and transmitted via modem to the manufacturers' Clozapine Registry and, in turn, to the FDA.</p>",

A weekly download of the accident reports are sent to the national database using MailMan messages. On a monthly basis, extracts are sent to the ASISTS central repository located at the Austin Information Technology Center. The VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) provides multiple customized reports on the VSSC Web portal available on the VA Intranet.

Local sites require the capability to determine in real time, the effects of any procedural or policy changes relating to productivity and efficiency. Data collected by each individual medical center is compiled on a national level at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) for P&amp;LMS Central Office utilization. Each local medical center will have the capability to independently monitor laboratory trends and make appropriate decisions. A detailed view of workload data will be provided to support a variety of management and clinical requirements and needs. Measurements of productivity and efficiency data are capable of providing medical center to medical center comparisons. In addition, workload data is suitable for comparison to private sector facilities that capture laboratory workload based on Current Procedure Terminology (CPT). The National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program has been selected as the efficiency and productivity logic model. The National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program report replaces the Lab Automated Management Information System (AMIS) segment used in the past. Each local site identifies the reportable units based on CPT and VA guidelines. Reportable units are extracted by laboratory software and are transmitted to the AITC. The transmitted data is compiled and stored in the National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program database. This database supports P&amp;LMS Headquarters and Veterans Integrated Service Network director's office.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: \u2022 a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; \u2022 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or \u2022 for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.)

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

            "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides healthcare services to its veterans across the USA including territories and possessions. Healthcare services are delivered through 18 geographically divided administrative areas called Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN). Each VISN is divided into healthcare areas called Markets and Submarkets. Each Submarket is divided into Sectors and each Sector comprises one or more counties. In 1995 a process was created to coordinate and review the realignment of the Heath Care Networks. The Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process established VISN 'subsets' called Markets, Submarkets and Sectors which, being smaller than VISNs, allowed for more precise analyses for greater access measurement to health care.\n\n\nThe County layer is the base geographic unit of the VISN-Market-Submarket-Sector-County hierarchy. The key attribute in this data set is the FIPS which is defined as a string of 5 characters with unique alphanumeric combinations for each site. The first 2 are the State FIPS code and the next 3 designate the County FIPS code. Example: '01031' is the FIPS for Coffee County, Alabama.\n\n\nA Sector is a cluster of geographically adjacent counties within a VA Submarket. The process of aggregating counties into sectors uses a combination of automated algorithms and manual inspection of maps. The key attribute in this data set is the SECTOR which is defined as a string of eight characters broken down into four parts in the order of VISN (2-char), Market (1-char), Submarket (1-char), and Sector(1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Sector 12-a-3-A indicates VISN 12, Market a, Submarket 3 and Sector A.\n\n\nSub-markets reflect a clustering of the enrollee population within a market and are an aggregation of Sectors. The key attribute in this data set is the SUBMARKET which is defined as a string of six characters broken down in three parts in the order of VISN (2-char), Market (1-char), and Submarket (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Submarket 12-a-3 indicates VISN 12, Market a, and Submarket 3.\n\n\nCARES defines Markets as \"an aggregated geographic area having a sufficient population and geographic size to both benefit from the coordination and planning of health care services and to support a full healthcare delivery system (i.e. primary care, mental health care, inpatient care, tertiary care, and long term care)\". Each Market is built from Submarkets. The key attribute in this data set is the MARKET which is defined as a string of four characters broken down in two parts in the order of HCN (2-char) and Market (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example, Market 12-a indicates VISN 12 and Market a.\n\n\nThe key attribute in the VISN data set is defined as a string of two characters from 01-23, excluding 3, 11, 13, 14 and 18; a VISN also has an officially recognized VA title. For example, VISN 06 is the Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network. VISNs can span across neighboring countries to include areas that are not contiguous. For example, VISN 08 includes Florida and Puerto Rico in addition to most of Florida and southern Georgia, and VISN 20 includes Alaska and parts of the northwest conterminous United States. Each VISN is built from Markets, Submarkets, Sectors and Counties derived from Census (2010) County data.\n\n\nBecause VISNs are composed of VHA markets, VISN boundaries align with the outer edges of their constituent markets\u2019 boundaries. Markets cross state borders wherever it is necessary to keep outpatient clinics (e.g. Community-Based Outpatient Clinics(CBOCs)) and their catchment areas in the same market as their parent medical centers. Thus, VISN boundaries also cross state borders. In 2016 senior leadership considered the challenge of conforming VISN boundaries to MyVA Districts, which coincide with state boundaries. It was agreed that VHA would not separate outpatient clinics from their parent medical centers due to added complexity. Many outpat",

The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

            "description": "<p>In 2009, the Department of Defense estimated that approximately 40,000 service members who served in OEF/OIF may have embedded fragment wounds as the result of small arms fire or a blast or explosion caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), rocket propelled grenade (RPG), landmine, grenade, or enemy or friendly fire. Studies have shown that embedded fragments are not inert in the body, but may breakdown slowly over time and potentially affect an individual\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds health. The recognition of potential short and long-term health effects of embedded fragments and the large number of soldiers with injuries resulting in embedded fragments led the Presidential Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes to recommend that the VHA establish a registry and medical surveillance program for Veterans with retained fragments. The Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center (TEFSC) has been established at the Baltimore VA Medical Center to coordinate this charge. A critical component of the TEFSC medical surveillance program is the development of an Embedded Fragment Registry. This registry provides a mechanism to identify Veterans with embedded fragments, manage clinical data related to embedded fragments, and develop medical and surgical guidelines that will enable the TEFSC staff and VA clinicians to deliver appropriate medical care to these Veterans.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

MPCR receives financial data feeds from Decision Support System and workload data feeds from National Patient Care Database, Home Based Primary Care and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Work Measurement in order to provide the VHA with a flexible cost reporting system. The MPCR is assembled from information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). MPCR is processed monthly and consists of two reports: station level and a national level rollup. These two reports are available to users via Roger's Software Development (RSD) on the Austin Information Technology Center mainframe and CD ROM. The primary users of MPCR are the VAMC staff, VHA Budget Office, Medical Care Cost Recovery, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

The Patient Treatment File (PTF) contains a record for each inpatient care episode provided under VA auspices in VA and non-VA facilities nationwide. Each episode contains data on admission, diagnosis, procedures, surgical episodes, and disposition (discharge) information and Diagnostic Related Group (DRG). Each transfer is recorded to allocate days of care properly to the service(s) responsible for that care. Recurring and special purpose reports are used for studies on patient movement trends, diagnostic frequency, workload, budget preparation, Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) assignment and accreditation requirements. Reports are available for online access via Roger's Software Development's (RSD) Online Report Viewing. Several large data files are installed on-line at the Austin Information Technology Center for remote access. Selected data can be downloaded to perform end user processing, including report generation. Information is received from a variety of modules in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture. This batch system is written in Common Business Oriented Language and ALC. Processing is done on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.</p>",

Detailed information about the specific coding strategy is available in Comparative Effectiveness Review [CER] No. 207, Psychological and Pharmacological Treatments for Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. (See our \"Risk of Bias\" data story.)\nMost domains were rated as Yes (i.e., minimal risk of bias), No (i.e., high risk of bias) or Unclear (i.e., bias could not be determined). The overall study rating is based on the domains and is coded as low, medium or high risk of bias. The 4 domains that were included as components of the overall rating include: Selection bias--randomization adequate, allocation concealment adequate, groups similar at baseline and whether they used intention to treat analyses; Performance bias--care providers masked and patients masked; Detection bias--outcome assessors masked; Attrition bias--overall attrition less than or equal to 20% vs over 20%; differential attrition less than or equal to 15% vs over 15%.\nAdditional items assessed (but not considered as part of the overall rating) include: Reporting bias--all prespecified outcomes reported; Reporting bias--method for handling dropouts; Outcome measures equal valid and reliable; Study reports adequate treatment fidelity based on measurements by independent raters.",

The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

            "description": "<p>User provisioning is the process of associating a digital identity with one or more resource access accounts, which may serve as records for user data and permissions. This may include the creation, modification, deletion, suspension, or restoration of such accounts and also synchronizing user data. Managing user accounts locally creates redundancy in collecting and managing user information. This may lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies with user data that is stored in authoritative sources, and this may also create security vulnerabilities by maintaining accounts for terminated users. By leveraging Provisioning, VA applications are able to centrally manage user information, attributes, roles, and accounts using data from authoritative identity sources. Once a manually intensive and disjointed process, VAs Provisioning (Prov) service leverages automated and centralized workflows to enhance security and bolster efficiency. As a result, application administrators, who previously had to manually manage user administration, now have services available to automate the process. Provisioning assigns the Security Identifier (SecID) as a unique user identifier for integrated applications to use for user authorization and audit. SecID is a unique ID assigned to a user when they are added to the Provisioning system via an on-boarding event. SecID, once assigned, remains the same even if the user status with VA changes over time (i.e., a Veteran becomes a contractor and then later becomes an employee). SecID is the identifier used to correlate Provisioning records to MVIs integration control number (ICN), which is the unique person identifier. Provisioning automates the on-boarding and off-boarding flows. Applications leveraging Provisioning gain an added benefit of automated account removal (deprovisioning) during off-boarding. The following table lists the detailed functions offered by the Provisioning service. Additionally, the Provisioning service includes a Role Engineering and Compliance Tool (RECT) that can help applications:  Conduct Role Analysis: Provides the ability to analyze current roles and permissions to rapidly build and deploy an enterprise role model  Certify User Roles: Provides the ability to have access privileges reviewed and managed by designated reviewers</p>",

Each Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system contains a local CCR where patients who are potentially HIV or HCV infected are identified based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes and/or positive antibody test results. The local HIV or HCV coordinator must review these cases to determine which patients are truly infected and should be added to the local registry. The local CCR provides extensive reporting capabilities to the local HIV and HCV clinicians to monitor their patient population. The local CCR software also extracts data elements from multiple VistA packages and transmits Health Level Seven (HL7) messages to the national database at VA Austin Information Technology Center. The national database is used for monitoring clinical outcomes, assessing resource utilization and quality assurance.</p>",

The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) is a comprehensive assessment and care planning process used by the nursing home industry since 1990 as a requirement for nursing home participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The RAI/MDS provides data for monitoring changes in resident status that are consistent and reliable over time. The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV). Residents are assessed quarterly. The data is grouped for analysis at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Conversion to electronic data entry and transmission to the AITC was completed system-wide by year-end 2000. In 2010, the Centeres for Medicare and Medicaide Services released a significantly upgraded version, MDS 3.0, to begin to be implemented on October 1, 2011 in VHA CLCs.  Training is underway currently.  The MDS 3.0 will generate a new set of Quality Indicators and Quality Monitors as well the RUGs will increase to 64 RUGs from the current 53 RUG groups.</p>",

It includes the Veterans\u2019 sex. Blank values represent small cell counts that have been suppressed to protect the identity of Veterans as well as some cell counts that have been suppressed in order to prevent the determination of the values of the aforementioned small cell counts. Some categories may not sum to the total due to missing information (e.g., sex, etc.).\n\nThe availability of sex data is limited as some records have no sex available. In the table, there are 123 Veterans whose sex is not available.\n\nThere are a small number of pension recipients for whom neither state nor country could be determined from the data sources used.  These pension recipients are not included in the table.\n\nThe number of Veterans who were pension recipients during FY 2023 but were no longer pension recipients at the end of FY 2023 is 32,176.  These Veterans are not included in the table.\n\nSource: Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Enterprise Integration, Veteran Object FY23 data and Veterans Benefits Administration VETSNET FY 2023 pension data.\n\nPrepared by National Center for Veterans Analysis & Statistics, www.va.gov/vetdata.",

The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

This table displays the count and percent, by county, of Veterans who are farmers and/or dairymen comparative for the entire state's population of Veteran farmers or dairymen in California for 2015. The data was created from our administrative database U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS), for the recent event Apps for Ag Hackathon.  \n\n\nThe U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS) is the single integrated dataset of Veteran demographic and socioeconomic data. It provides the most comprehensive picture of the Veteran population possible to support statistical, trend and longitudinal analysis. USVETS has both a static dataset, represents a single authoritative record of all living and deceased Veterans, and fiscal year datasets, represents a snapshot of a Veteran for each fiscal year. USVETS consists mainly of data sources from the Veterans Benefit Administration, the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center, and other data sources including commercial data sources. This dataset contains information about individual Veterans including demographics, details of military service, VA benefit usage, and more. The dataset contains one record per Veteran. It includes all living and deceased Veterans. USVETS data includes Veterans residing in states, US territories and foreign countries. VA uses this database to conduct statistical analytics, predictive modeling, and other data reporting. USVETS includes the software, hardware, and the associated processes that produce various VA work products and related files for Veteran analytics.",

            "description": "<p>The Consolidated Copayment Processing Center (CCPC) database contains Veteran patient contact and billing information in order to support the printing and mailing of patient billing statements. The CCPC system is designed to handle first-party medical debt billing information. First-party billing is defined as a patient debt for which the patient is responsible for payment (normally co-payment) for health care treatment. This differs from third-party billing where a third party (e.g., insurance company, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)) is primarily responsible for repaying the VA. CCPC does not handle third-party billing information. The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture Accounts Receivable (AR) module collects information for CCPC at every Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). A daily batch process is used to collect and transmit the information to the VA Austin Information Technology Center. All collected patient and billing information is kept active on CCPC for a period of one month. A master list containing six months activity is archived for reference should historical information be needed. The users of this database include the VAMCs, Veterans Health Administration Chief Business Office, and the patients who receive billing statements.</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

Please see individual Monograph entries for specific details on:  Ionizing Radiation Registry (IRR), Agent Orange Registry (AOR), and the Gulf War Registry (GWR).</p>",

Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients, VHA, working with the VA Office of Information and Technology, implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006, a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW's content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.  The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.</p>",

This database contains assessments of selected surgical operations performed at Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). Addition to the SRA database requires that the surgery is Major (as defined by the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes assigned to the surgery), it must not be cardiac related, and it may not be concurrent with another surgery. Frequently performed other types of surgeries may also be excluded. Nurse reviewers at VAMCs gather the information from surgical data located in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. Information is also collected from pre-and post-operative charts and from interviews with patients. This information is entered into VistA and transmitted daily by a batch process to the Hines Office of Information &amp; Technology (OI&amp;T) Field Office. While the database has been in operation since 1995, the system only contains data for the current fiscal year. The data from previous fiscal years is archived if later retrieval is needed. Valid transmissions are sent to the VASQIP office at Denver for analysis. Information from non-assessed surgeries is transmitted from the VAMCs to the Hines OI Field Office monthly. This is also passed along to VASQIP at Denver. The users of this database include the VASQIP Executive Board.</p>",

This database is used to monitor the status of the VHA's collection process and to provide visibility on the types of bills and collections being done by the Department. The objective of the VA MCCF Program is to collect reimbursement from third party health insurers and co-payments from certain non-service-connected (NSC) Veterans for the cost of medical care furnished to Veterans.  Legislation has authorized VHA to: submit claims to and recover payments from Veterans' third party health insurance carriers for treatment of non-service-connected conditions; recover co-payments from certain Veterans for treatment of non-service-connected conditions; and recover co-payments for medications from certain Veterans for treatment of non-service-connected conditions. All of the information captured in the MCCR NDB is derived from the Accounts Receivable (AR) modules running at each medical center. MCCR NDB is not used for official collections figures; instead, the Department uses the Financial Management System (FMS).</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

This system is the Department's only means of complying with Public Laws (e.g., PL 101-576 - the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990) that mandate the use of a MCA system that can assign costs to the product level. MCA cost data is used at all levels of the VA for important functions, such as cost recovery (billing), budgeting and resource allocation. Additionally, the system contains a rich repository of clinical information which is used to promote a more proactive approach to the care of high risk (i.e., diabetes and acute coronary patients) and high cost patients. The data in MCA is also used to calculate and measure the productivity of physicians and other care providers.</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAMS. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

All programs are closed to new issues except for Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance and Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance.  United States Government Life Insurance was issued to WWI military personnel and Veterans.  National Service Life Insurance was established to meet the needs of WWII military personnel and Veterans.  Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially-adapted housing.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

For changes in operating, unavailable and authorized bed levels, the Director of a Medical Center or his/her authorized delegate enters a bed change request into the Bed Control Database. A Bed Control Database trigger automatically notifies the respective Veterans Integrated Support Network (VISN) director. The VISN director's designated staff reviews the request and either approves, disapproves, or cancels it through the Bed Control Database. If a medical center request is approved by the VISN director, a Bed Control Database trigger notifies staff in the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management (10N) to review and take action, followed by the appropriate VHA Program Office and then the Under Secretary for Health. Once a request has been approved, cancelled, or disapproved by either the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, VHA Program Office, or the Under Secretary for Health, the medical center director and the appropriate VISN director are automatically notified of the action. The approval process is tracked and visible to the authorized user of the system. When changes are approved, the database updates its bed level information accordingly. Pertinent justification and documents associated with each bed change request are stored in the database.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Patient Assessment File (PAF) database compiles the results of the Patient Assessment Instrument (PAI) questionnaire filled out for intermediate care Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. The PAI is filled out within two weeks of admission. It is also completed semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st for each patient by a registered nurse familiar with the patient. The PAI questions cover medical treatments, conditions, selected diagnoses, activities of daily living, behaviors, some rehabilitation therapies, and chronic respiratory support. The database is managed by the Geriatrics &amp; Extended Care Strategic Health Care Group in the Office of Patient Care Services. It is currently running at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and is stored in flat files. PAF's primary customer is the Allocation Resource Center (ARC) in Braintree MA. The ARC receives the data from AITC and combines it with data from the Patient Treatment File (PTF) which contains more detailed demographic and treatment information. The ARC builds ORACLE tables, assigning RUG II (Resource Utilization Group II) scores and weighted work units reflecting the level and type of care needed. The 16 different weighted work units, ranging from 479 to 1800, are a factor in the resource allocation and budget decisions on long-term care, and are used to measure efficiency. The data is also used in other reports to Central Office, the Veterans Integrated Service Networks, and the facilities. Several other units also use PAF information including the Decision Support System (DSS). Currently, PAF is in the process of being replaced by the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS). RAI/MDS uses a much more extensive questionnaire as its source of information. The RAI/MDS provides clinical data and care protocols in addition to the newer RUG III scores, and is required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service funded hospitals.</p>",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

OHRS is a web-based application that enables employee occupational health staff to create, maintain, and monitor medical records for VA employees and generate national, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), and site-specific reports.The focus of OHRS is to collect clinical data for wellness, medical surveillance, and appropriate treatment of work-based injury or illness. OHRS will capture and store information on patient encounters, such as encounter type, purpose, status, provider, and other pertinent clinical data obtained during the patient visit. Users with appropriate security privileges are allowed to add and sign or co-sign the encounter and, if needed, perform scheduled and unscheduled reporting on items such as vaccination rates, vaccination and immunity statuses. The OHRS application does not share patient-specific data, but will collect data elements limited to information deemed critical to the Occupational Health delivery of care processes in the OHRS database. Employee data is obtained from the central Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data System (PAID) while volunteer information is obtained from the Voluntary Service System (VSS). Other Non-Paid and non-VSS data is collected by direct data entry into OHRS at the time of the patient encounter. OHRS is further designed to document, track and report immunizations administered to other Federal Agency employees outside of VA.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

            "description": "<p>Beginning with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 (GPEA), the Federal government has encouraged the use of electronic / digital signatures to enable electronic transactions with agencies, while still providing a means for proof of user consent and non-repudiation. To support this capability, some means of reliable user identity management must exist. Currently, Veterans have to physically print, sign, and mail various documents that, in turn, need to be processed by VA. This process creates a huge inconvenience on the part of the veteran and a financial burden on VA. eSig enables veterans and their surrogates to digitally sign forms that require a high level of verification that the user signing the document is a legitimate and authorized user. In addition, eSig provides a mechanism for VA applications to verify the authenticity of user documents and data integrity on user forms. This capability is enabled by the eSig service. The eSig service signing process includes the following steps: 1. Form Signing Attestation: The user affirms their intent to electronically sign the document and understands re-authentication is part of that process. 2. Re-Authentication: The user must refresh their authentication by repeating the authentication process. 3. Form Signing: The form and the identity of the user are presented to the eSig service, where they are digitally bound and secured. 4. Form Storage: The signed form must be stored for later validation. In this process, the application is entirely responsible for steps 1, 2, and 4. In step 3, the application must use the eSig web service to request signing of the document. The following table lists the detailed functions offered by the eSig service.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA EDUCATION BENEFITS PROGRAM to help servicepersons adjust to civilian life after separation from military service, assist in the recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel in the active and reserve components in the Armed Forces by providing education benefits, and to provide educational opportunities to the dependents of certain service members and veterans. Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

The information is obtained from a wide variety of medical record documents at the local medical center pertaining to each Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cancer patient. The information is then transmitted to the VACCR. Details collected include extensive demographics, cancer identification, extent of disease and staging, first course of treatment, and outcomes. Data extraction is available to researchers with VA approved Institutional Review Board studies, peer review, and Data Use Agreements.</p>",

Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: \u2022 a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; \u2022 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or \u2022 for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability.

Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: \u2022 a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; \u2022 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or \u2022 for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

PCMM supports both Primary Care and non-Primary Care teams.  The software allows the user to set up and define a team, assign positions to the team, assign staff to the positions, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to a Primary Care Provider (PCP) or Associate Provider (AP).  In a Primary Care setting, patients are assigned a PCP, Associate Provider (AP) and/or a Transition Patient Advocate (TPA) who is responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care.  The PCP is supported by a team of professionals which may include nurses, pharmacists, social workers, etc.  Associate Providers are non-physician clinicians (such as Physicians Assistants, Nurse Practitioners or Residents) who may provide care under the supervision of a presiding PCP.  The PCMM software is considered to be an important component to measure patient demand and the PCPs capacity to meet that demand and to reduce wait times. PCMM was developed to assist facilities in implementing primary care for veterans.  It uses the site's data to identify patients and to assign them to a PCP.  PCMM provides tools to facilitate the startup process, automating such tasks as identifying patients to be assigned to primary care; assigning patients to teams, and assigning patients to practitioners via team positions.</p>",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

            "description": "<p>VBA EDUCATION BENEFITS PROGRAM to help servicepersons adjust to civilian life after separation from military service, assist in the recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel in the active and reserve components in the Armed Forces by providing education benefits, and to provide educational opportunities to the dependents of certain service members and veterans. Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

In March 2007, a Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) OIF/OEF TBI Screening Reminder was released.  This is a first-line screening tool to identify potential TBI patients.  Additional information about veterans who have been identified as possible TBI patients by the initial Screening Reminder is collected through a Comprehensive TBI evaluation.  Reminder results, in the form of Health Factors, Comprehensive TBI evaluation data, and Comprehensive TBI Follow-up results of individual Veterans will be sent to a national database.  This data will be aggregated in order to provide relevant responses to key stakeholders, such as members of Congress, to monitor the quality of care and to implement system improvements. In addition, tracking applications will be used to collect data on TBI patient appointments.</p>",

Section 208 of the Electronic Government Act of 2002 (E-Gov Act) requires federal agencies to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) on information technology systems that either (1) collect, maintain, and/or disseminate Personally Identifiable Information (PII); or (2) make substantial changes to existing technology that manages PII.. A PIA is an analysis of how PII is collected, stored, protected, shared, and managed. Its purpose is to demonstrate that the information system owners and/or developers have incorporated privacy protections throughout the lifecycle of the system. Absent a legitimate security or sensitivity concern demonstrated by the agency, the E-Gov Act requires agencies to make PIAs publicly available.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Privacy, FOIA, and Records Management strive to be the leader among Federal Information Technology (IT) organizations in protecting the privacy of Veterans' personal data. Our goal is to respond to mandates to meet the needs of Veterans, while improving the protection of their personal information.To view a PIA for a particular system, go to the heading labeled 'System Operating with a Current/Valid FY2013 PIA' and select the name of the program/project of interest.</p>",

All programs are closed to new issues except for Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance and Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance.  United States Government Life Insurance was issued to WWI military personnel and Veterans.  National Service Life Insurance was established to meet the needs of WWII military personnel and Veterans.  Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially-adapted housing.</p>",

All programs are closed to new issues except for Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance and Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance.  United States Government Life Insurance was issued to WWI military personnel and Veterans.  National Service Life Insurance was established to meet the needs of WWII military personnel and Veterans.  Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially-adapted housing.</p>",

The mission of MHV is to transform the  delivery of health and health care for all Veterans, independent of where they receive care, by providing one-stop, online access to better manage their overall health, make informed health decisions, and record and store important health and military history information. MHV provides access to VA health care and information 24/7 through web-based tools that empower Veterans to become active partners in their health care.  MHV registrants can click a 'Blue Button' on the website to view, print or download their available personal health information and military service information. They can choose to share that information with other providers, caregivers, family members or job advocates safely, securely, and privately.  Web technology combines essential health record information enhanced by online health resources. This enables and encourages patient/clinician collaboration. The online environment maps closely to existing clinical business practices and extends management and delivery of care.  MHV allows VA patients to request and receive VA prescription refills and provides a blended history of VA and self-entered medications.  Registrants whose personal identities have been verified as VA patients can receive copies of select VA electronic health records, including VA Appointments, Chemistry/Hematology Lab Results, Allergies and Wellness Reminders.  Many VA patients are communicating with their participating health care teams through Secure Messaging.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.</p>",

Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program.

It stores information on VAMC investigators, project budget allocations and expenditures, initial project abstracts, progress reports and research space. VA Medical Centers collect and submit the data using an application called electronic Project Management and Information System (ePROMISE). That data is submitted to Veterans Affairs Central Office and becomes a component of RDIS. ePROMISE collects data from over 150 VA facilities (including 75 VAMCs). VA funded, non-VA funded and non-funded research proposals are reviewed and must be approved by the Research and Development (R&amp;D) Committee and relevant R&amp;D Subcommittees (Human Studies, Animal Use, and/or Biosafety) at each VAMC. Basic information on research projects approved by the VAMC Research and Development committee is transmitted to the RDIS, which tracks the life cycle of these projects.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>",

Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: \u2022 a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; \u2022 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or \u2022 for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

As defined by the Census Bureau, Rural encompasses all population, housing, and territory not included within an Urban area (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html). \n\nThis table contains the Veteran estimates by urban/rural, sex, age group, and ethnicity.\n\nNote: rounding to the nearest 1,000 is always appropriate for VetPop estimates.",

The MVI includes authoritative sources for health identity data and contains over 17 million patient entries populated from all VHA facilities nationwide.  The MVI provides the access point mechanism for linking patient's information to enable an enterprise-wide view of patient information, uniquely identifies all active patients who have been admitted, treated, or registered in any VHA facility, and assigns a unique identifier to the patient.  The MVI correlates a patient's identity across the enterprise, including all VistA systems and external systems, such as Department of Defense (DoD) and the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN).  The MVI facilitates the sharing of health information, resulting in coordinated and integrated health care for Veterans.  New Information Technology systems must be interoperable with the MVI and legacy systems will establish integration by October 1, 2012.  The Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) Team within VHA's Data Quality Program is the steward of patient identity data, performing maintenance and support activities.</p>",

The ARC is part of the Resource Allocation &amp; Execution Office of the Office of Finance. The database is developed from the Patient Treatment File, National Patient Care Database, Fee Basis Medical and Pharmacy System, Decision Support System (DSS) National extracts, DSS Derived Monthly Program Cost Report (MPCR), Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) Minimum Data Set (MDS), Clinical Case Registry (CCR), and Home Dialysis Data Collection System, the Pharmacy Benefits Management database and the Consolidated Enrollment File. Most of the clinical data is Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture data which is transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) where it is retrieved by the ARC each month. The ARC also retrieves DSS cost data from the AITC as well. Some additional information is received from the Hines Pharmacy Benefits Management and the CCR databases. The data from these sources is combined to develop patient-specific care and cost data for each hospitalization or visit at the location or treatment level. Aggregate tables summarize this data for reporting and analysis purposes. The VERA databases are the basis for resource allocation in the Veterans Health Administration.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

Included is information on score differences, p-value for statistical test, and study-reported effect sizes. \n\nWhere possible, the between-arm standardized effect size was calculated, using Hedges\u2019 g. We calculated Hedges\u2019 g based on the following (in order of preference): 1) adjusted mean difference; 2) follow-up scores; 3) unadjusted mean difference; 4) change scores. For the calculated effect size, information on the basis for calculation is included along with measures of variance. Negative values for Hedges\u2019 g indicate a larger decrease (or lower follow-up score) in the first arm than in the second arm, while positive values indicate the reverse. \n\nEach comparison is on a separate row, and pairwise as well as omnibus (multi-arm) comparisons are included. There are also separate rows for each measure, time point and analysis type.",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

            "description": "<p>Voluntary Service System (VSS) is a national-level application which replaced the site-based Voluntary Timekeeping System (VTK). VTK was used for many years at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers to track and manage the hours of service contributed by volunteers and volunteer organizations. Consistency of data between sites was a problem and the process of compiling national VTK reports was slow and costly. Many steps were involved because national data was only consolidated once a month and it was usually out of sync. Improved data collection and reporting is now available since users interact directly with a centralized national database. Rehosted VSS uses .NET technology that replaced data transmissions between sites and the Austin Information Technology Center to produce the consolidated national reports. Direct access to data provides instantaneous updates and up-to-the-minute reporting for all users. Central Office administrators and Voluntary staff now have broader more reliable data for managing Volunteer Services.</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill \u2013 Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on the latest changes to the Post-9/11 GI Bill go to the VA web-site.</p>",

Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.</p>",

The participant must have entered on active duty on or after January 1, 1977, and before July 1, 1985, and either served on active duty for more than 180 continuous days receiving an other than dishonorable discharge, or have been discharged after January, 1, 1977 because of a service-connected disability. Also eligible are participants who serve for more than 180 days and who continue on active duty and have completed their first period of obligated service (or 6 years of active duty, whichever comes first). Participants must also have satisfactorily contributed to the program. (Satisfactory contribution consists of monthly deduction of $25 to $100 from military pay, up to a maximum of $2,700, for deposit in a special training fund.) Participants may make lump-sum contributions. No individuals on active duty in the Armed Forces may initially begin contributing to this program after March 31, 1987.</p>",

Generally, to qualify for benefits under REAP you must have served at least 90 consecutive days on active duty as a result of a call or order to active duty from a reserve component in response to a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements. For more information on MGIB-SR and REAP visit <a href=\"http://www.gibill.va.gov\">http://www.gibill.va.gov</a>.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

United States Government Life Insurance was issued to WWI military personnel and Veterans.  National Service Life Insurance was established to meet the needs of WWII military personnel and Veterans.  Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially-adapted housing.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Nuclear Medicine National HQ System database is a series of MS Excel spreadsheets and Access Database Tables by fiscal year. They consist of information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) performing or contracting nuclear medicine services in Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The medical centers are required to complete questionnaires annually (RCS 10-0010-Nuclear Medicine Service Annual Report). The information is then manually entered into the Access Tables, which includes: * Distribution and cost of in-house VA - Contract Physician Services, whether contracted services are made via sharing agreement (with another VA medical facility or other government medical providers) or with private providers. * Workload data for the performance and/or purchase of PET/CT studies. * Organizational structure of services. * Updated changes in key imaging service personnel (chiefs, chief technicians, radiation safety officers). * Workload data on the number and type of studies (scans) performed, including Medicare Relative Value Units (RVUs), also referred to as Weighted Work Units (WWUs). WWUs are a workload measure calculated as the product of a study's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, which consists of total work costs (the cost of physician medical expertise and time), and total practice costs (the costs of running a practice, such as equipment, supplies, salaries, utilities etc). Medicare combines WWUs together with one other parameter to derive RVUs, a workload measure widely used in the health care industry. WWUs allow Nuclear Medicine to account for the complexity of each study in assessing workload, that some studies are more time consuming and require higher levels of expertise. This gives a more accurate picture of workload; productivity etc than using just 'total studies' would yield. * A detailed Full-Time Equivalent Employee (FTEE) grid, and staffing distributions of FTEEs across nuclear medicine services. * Information on Radiation Safety Committees and Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs).  Beginning in 2011 this will include data collection on part-time and non VA (contract) RSOs; other affiliations they may have and if so to whom they report (supervision) at their VA medical center.<em>Collection of data on nuclear medicine services' progress in meeting the special needs of our female veterans.</em> Revolving documentation of all major VA-owned gamma cameras (by type) and computer systems, their specifications and ages. * Revolving data collection for PET/CT cameras owned or leased by VA; and the numbers and types of PET/CT studies performed on VA patients whether produced on-site, via mobile PET/CT contract or from non-VA providers in the community.* Types of educational training/certification programs available at VA sites * Ongoing funded research projects by Nuclear Medicine (NM) staff, identified by source of funding and research purpose. * Data on physician-specific quality indicators at each nuclear medicine service.* Academic achievements by NM staff, including published books/chapters, journals and abstracts. * Information from polling field sites re: relevant issues and programs Headquarters needs to address. * Results of a Congressionally mandated contracted quality assessment exercise, also known as a Proficiency study. Study results are analyzed for comparison within VA facilities (for example by mission or size), and against participating private sector health care groups. * Information collected on current issues in nuclear medicine as they arise.  Radiation Safety Committee structures and membership, Radiation Safety Officer information and information on how nuclear medicine services provided for female Veterans are examples of current issues.The database is now stored completely within MS Access Database Tables with output still presented in the form of Excel graphs and tables.</p>",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>",

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans\u2019 access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics. A complete list of VISN facilities with components reviewed as part of the Access Audit is included in this package</p>",

The primary purpose is to provide HBPC management with case mix, case load, and other performance information. The HBPC information system is referred to as HBC at the VA Austin Information Technology Center and as HBHC at the local level. The HBHC automated a paper-based system of reporting home care episodes. When an admission form is completed, an episode is opened and input into HBHC for a potential home care patient. The patient is evaluated and accepted to or rejected from the program. When a patient leaves the program for any reason an episode is closed and a discharge form completed and input into HBHC. HBHC runs a nightly extract of information within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture. Extractions include information on all Patient Care Encounters (PCEs) with the patient and home visits made by home care providers. Details of which provider(s) made the visit, the date, any diagnosis and any procedures performed are included. Each local application sends its data to the Austin HBC database on a monthly basis. A monthly report is prepared based on this information identifying the active cases at each VAMC. A more detailed quarterly report is produced that includes national comparisons among sites.</p>",

The contents of the databases are a compiliation of the electronic contract management system(eCMS), the financial management system(FMS), and status information provided by CFM's engineering staff.  Due to the nature of the contract and financial management system information, the systems access is restricted to CFM personnel and select contractors working for CFM.  The reason for two project management programs is because Tririga is a replacement program for Paragon.  Once training has been completed and the Paragon data has been migrated to Tririga, Paragon use will be discontinued.  Paragon and Tririga are web based applications hosted by contractors outside of the VA intranet system.  Tririga will be the main construction management program as of June 2014.</p>",
