To help the federal government meet these energy goals, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on January 9 directing the administration to conduct a Quadrennial Energy Review (QER). As described in the President\u2019s Climate Action Plan, this first-ever review will focus on energy infrastructure and will identify the threats, risks, and opportunities for U.S. energy and climate security, enabling the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of integrated actions. The Presidential Memorandum created an interagency task force co-chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Special Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. The Department of Energy will help coordinate interagency activities and provide policy analysis and modeling, and stakeholder engagement.",

Competitive awards will further the innovation by states and local governments seeking to implement high-impact and self-sustaining clean energy projects. In addition, technical assistance will help to facilitate clean energy programs and practices through \"best practice\" tools, \u201clead-by-example\u201d methods, peer-to-peer forums, and other strategic partnerships.",

First conducted in 1978, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey is a national sample survey that collects energy-related data for housing units occupied as a primary residence and the households that live in them. Data were collected from more than 5,600 households selected at random using a complex multistage, area-probability sample design. The sample represents 118.2 million U.S. households. The 1st version of the 2015 RECS microdata file, released in April 2017, reflected preliminary household characteristics data. The file was updated in October 2017 (Version 2) to include additional square footage and household energy insecurity data. The file was updated again in May 2018 (Version 3) and included final household characteristics data, as well as final consumption and expenditures data. The final version of the microdata file was updated in December 2018 (Version 4) and contains wood consumption variables, as well as additional weather and climate-related variables used in the end-use modeling process.",

First conducted in 1978, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey is a national sample survey that collects energy-related data for housing units occupied as a primary residence and the households that live in them. Data were collected from 12,083 households selected at random using a complex multistage, area-probability sample design. The sample represents 113.6 million U.S. households, the Census Bureau's statistical estimate for all occupied housing units in 2009 derived from their American Community Survey (ACS).",

The CBECS was first conducted in 1979; the eighth, and most recent survey, was conducted in 2003. CBECS is currently conducted on a quadrennial basis.",

Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been flattened into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the sample collection values will be repeated through the set; e.g. sample ID#, barcode, latitude/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.  These results represent raw data that have been calibrated  to physical units and validated. They do not include any further evaluation.",

To accomplish this objective, the authors analyzed renewable resource data both statistically and graphically utilizing a state-of-the-art Geographic Information System (GIS), a computer-based information system used to create and visualize geographic information. Land-use and environmental exclusions were applied to represent the most viable resources across the country. While wind, solar, and biomass are considered major renewable resources, other renewable energy resources could also be used for hydrogen production, thus contributing to hydrogen development locally and regionally. These additional resources include offshore wind, concentrating solar power, geothermal, hydropower, photoelectrochemical, and photobiological resources. This study found that approximately 1 billion metric tons of hydrogen could be produced annually from wind, solar, and biomass resources in the United States. The greatest potential for producing hydrogen from these key renewable resources is in the Great Plains region. In addition, this research suggests that renewable hydrogen has the potential to displace gasoline consumption in most states if and when a number of technical and scientific barriers can be overcome.",
