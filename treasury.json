The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the yield on a nominal coupon bond that pays semiannual interest.  Data updated daily on weekdays.",

Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the yield on a nominal coupon bond that pays semiannual interest.",

Capital reassures an institution\u2019s depositors, creditors and counterparties--and the institution itself--that an event such as an unexpected surge in losses or an unanticipated deterioration in earnings will not impair its ability to engage in lending to creditworthy borrowers and protect the savings of its depositors. During this period of heightened economic uncertainty, U.S. federal banking supervisors believe that the largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) should have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers in a more severe recession than is anticipated. For this reason, the Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors embarked on a comprehensive simultaneous assessment of the capital held by the 19 largest U.S. BHCs in February of this year.",

This dataset categorizes transactions by program type, according to the five approved SSBCI programs: Capital Access Programs, Collateral Support Programs, Loan Guarantee Programs, Loan Participation Programs, and Venture Capital Programs. The transaction level data was reported to Treasury by Participating States on an annual basis, as required by the Allocation Agreements. Participating States included all 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data fields provided here include the total financing amount, the amount of federal dollars expended, the date of the transaction, and the industry, zip code, and FTEs of the business receiving financing at the point of transaction, among other fields. The data files are available for public use. This dataset provides quantitative information that can be used for analysis of federal expenditure in supporting small business and economic development in identifying how and where federal financing was used.",

Because protecting the identities of MHA participants is of primary importance, the Treasury Department conducts a thorough analysis and takes steps to ensure the anonymity of individual borrowers. \r\n\r\nThe MHA Data File consists of three sets of loan-level mortgage modification data: The First Lien Modification Program, the Second Lien Modification Program, and the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program. The First Lien Modification Program also contains one additional subset - the net present value (NPV) file. Each set is subdivided into ten geographic regions that cover the United States and its territories. The data are presented in comma separated value (CSV) format and total roughly 3 gigabytes in size. \r\n\r\nThe information contained in these files is data reported by servicers. Please consult the MHA Data File User Guide for a description of certain data quality issues and variances which could affect the use or interpretation of the data.  Treasury and the MHA Program Administrator continue to work with servicers to monitor data quality and remediate known issues.\r\n\r\nThese files are cumulative and will be refreshed monthly, providing users with up-to-date MHA data. The Making Home Affordable Data Files include information on:\r\n\r\n\u2022Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program, \r\n\u2022Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA), \r\n\u2022Second Lien Modification Program (2MP), \r\n\u2022Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP), \r\n\u2022FHA-HAMP and \r\n\u2022Rural Development HAMP (RD-HAMP). \r\nPRA, UP, Treasury FHA-HAMP, and RD-HAMP are included in the First Lien Modification files, with 2MP and HAFA in separate files. The Making Home Affordable Data File User Guide has been updated to reflect these additions.",

Part 103), FinCEN may bring an enforcement action for violations of the reporting, recordkeeping, or other requirements of the BSA. FinCEN's Office of Enforcement evaluates enforcement matters that may result in a variety of remedies, including the assessment of civil money penalties. For example, civil money penalties may be assessed for recordkeeping violations under 31 C.F.R \u00a71010.415 (formerly 31 C.F.R. \u00a7103.29), or for reporting violations for failing to file a currency transaction report (CTR) in violation of 31 C.F.R. \u00a71010.311 (formerly 31 C.F.R. \u00a7103.22), a suspicious activity report (SAR) in violation of 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1021.320 (formerly 31 C.F.R. \u00a7103.21), or a report of foreign bank and financial accounts (FBAR) in violation of 31 C.F.R \u00a71010.350 (formerly 31 C.F.R. \u00a7103.24). FinCEN also takes enforcement actions against money services businesses (MSBs) for failure to register with FinCEN in violation of 31 C.F.R \u00a71022.380 (formerly 31 C.F.R. \u00a7103.41).",

Use of this form for FinCEN SARs was voluntary during the period of March 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013 and mandatory starting on April 1, 2013. FinCEN Form 111 has replaced the individual legacy SAR types formerly filed on TD F 90-22.47 (Depository Institutions), FinCEN Form 109 (Money Services Business), FinCEN Form 102 (Casinos & Card Clubs), and FinCEN Form 101 (Securities & Futures Industries). The statistics are based on the Bank Secrecy Act Identification Number of each record within the SAR system. The Bank Secrecy Act Identification Number is a unique number assigned to each SAR submitted. Statistical data for SARs are updated as information is processed and refreshed data is periodically made available for this tool. For this reason, there may be discrepancies between the statistical figures returned from queries performed at different times. In addition, slight differences in query criteria may return different statistical results. Also note that the statistics generated by this tool do not include SAR fields that contain unknown or blank data. To the extent statistics including blank or unknown data are tabulated outside of this tool for other purposes, there may be discrepancies between statistics generated by this tool and those generated through other means. FinCEN makes no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy or completeness of the statistical figures provided from this tool and expressly disclaims liability for errors, omissions, or discrepancies in the statistical figures.",

The data include the number of returns filed, number of personal exemptions claimed, total adjusted gross income, and aggregate migration flows at the State level, by the size of adjusted gross income (AGI) and by age of the primary taxpayer. Data are collected and based on year-to-year address changes reported on U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns (Form 1040) filed with the IRS.
