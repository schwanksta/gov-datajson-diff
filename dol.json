Employer-applicants meeting criteria established in the rule will receive a \u201cHIRE Vets Medallion Award.\u201d As described in the Act, there are different awards for large employers (500-plus employees), medium employers (51-499 employees), and small employers (50 or fewer employees). Additionally, there are two award tiers: platinum and gold. For each award, the employer must satisfy a set of criteria.\nThis dataset contains information from the application form completed by employers who applied to the HIRE Veterans Medallion Program.  Information collected includes: company identifier, personal identifier, hiring/retention statistics and program information in application process from businesses who wish to be recognized for outstanding veteran hiring/retention. Under the Act, VETS will:  1. Solicit applications No later than January 31; and 2.  Stop accepting applications on April 30.\"",

            "description": "In Fiscal Year 2010, the Longshore Division adopted a new set of performance measures aimed at improving program effectiveness by facilitating the prompt delivery of benefits to injured workers and their families. Two new performance measures target the timeliness of the Employer's First Report of Injury and the First Payment of Compensation, thereby improving initial claims processing and benefit delivery outcomes. The \"First Report of Injury\" measure tracks the time from the date of the injury or death, or the date of the employer's knowledge of the injury and the onset of disability, whichever is later, to the date the Longshore District Office receives the Employer's First Report of Injury (Form LS-202). The \"First Payment\" measure tracks the time it takes the employer or insurance carrier to issue the First Payment of Compensation after the worker becomes disabled for work or after the worker's death.  Performance targets aim to increase the percentage of cases in which employers submit their First Reports of Injury and employers and carriers issue the First Payments of Compensation within 30 days. Performance results are shown in the tables below. The DBA performance measures were introduced in 2010, and the non-DBA measures in 2011.",

Targeted largely to high school dropouts, YouthBuild is a federally and privately funded program that provides construction-related training, educational services, counseling, and leadership development opportunities to low-income, out-of-school youth ages 16 to 24. The evaluation included 75 existing YouthBuild programs who received funding from DOL or the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2011. The evaluation included an impact analysis (with 72 sites), process study (all 75), and a cost analysis (58 sites).  Overall, the impact study includes 3,929 sample members. Three sites were unable to contribute sample members to the impact study; among the remaining sites, the study sample size varied considerably from 250 to 9. (Twenty-three sites have 25 or fewer study participants.) The main impact analysis drew on three waves of survey data and two administrative records sources and pooled data across all sites. A program features analysis used the extensive implementation research data to investigate how impacts might vary based on site-level characteristics.",

This dataset contains all of the information used to conduct the non-experimental evaluation estimates for the 1) WIA Client Treatment Group and 2) The Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Client comparison group. The administrative data collected by IMPAQ for the \"Workforce Investment Act Non-Experimental Net Impact Evaluation\" project were received from state agencies in three segments: annual Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) or closely related files, Unemployment Insurance data, and Unemployment Insurance Wage Record data. The analysis were conducted for twelve states; however, based on the data sharing agreements, the Public Use Data (PUD) set includes data for nine states only. Our agreement for use of these data required that the identity of those states was not revealed. As a result, all geographical identifiers were removed to preserve states' anonymity.",

The 25 federally-administered states and 16 federally-recognized State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) use the Employment and Training Administration's Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Database System (RAPIDS) to provide individual apprentice and sponsor data. This subset of data is referred to as RAPIDS data and can be disaggregated to provide additional specificity. The federal subset of that data (25 states plus national programs) is known as the Federal Workload. The remaining federally recognized SAAs and the U.S. Military Apprenticeship Program (USMAP) provide limited aggregate data on a quarterly basis that is then combined with RAPIDS data to provide a national data set on high-level metrics (apprentices and programs) but cannot generally be broken out in greater detail beyond the data provided here.",

The grants ended in December 2012 and December 2015, respectively. As part of the YPD, grantees were required to implement a differential experimental research design whereby treatment group members received an additional level of service above and beyond the base level of services provided to the control group. The treatment interventions varied across grantees, with some providing mentoring services and others providing guided employment, education, training and related supports. More than 3,700 young parents and expectant parents were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.",

States report UI data to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on a monthly and quarterly basis under the UIRR system. The UIRR data are used for gathering economic statistics, allocating UI administrative funding, measuring state performance, and accounting for fund utilization. Therefore, it is important that states report UIRR data accurately and uniformly. States use the DV software provided by DOL to conduct the validation and submit results.",

With few exceptions (e.g., veterans), all eligible adults and dislocated workers in the LWIAs were randomly assigned to one of three research groups defined by the WIA-funded services that they could receive: (1) all WIA services, including training, (2) core and intensive services but not training, and (3) core services but not intensive or training services.

Also, it was designed to understand the relationship and flow of participants as they go through the public workforce system. The PWSD can be used to analyze these programs both individually and in combination. The PWSD contains economic variables, Unemployment Insurance System data, and data on programs funded by the Workforce Investment Act and Employment Service.

They also help participants address personal issues that impede their ability to work and assist them in finding unsubsidized jobs when the transitional jobs end. Prior studies of transitional jobs programs have shown mixed results. ETJD tested seven employment programs serving unemployed noncustodial parents or individuals recently released from prison. Although all of the programs were based on the same basic model, each program incorporated different enhancements to address the shortcomings of previously evaluated programs, with the goal of improving outcomes across a range of domains, including employment, criminal justice involvement, child support, and economic and personal well-being. There was a total of 7,000 sample members, roughly 1,000 per site. Impact analyses were conducted at both the pooled and site levels.",

Prices are median yearly prices for one child at the market rate. School-age prices reflect the school-year arrangement (part day). Childcare prices are based on the 2019-2022 data collection cycle  and are presented in 2022 real dollars using the CPI-U for child care (day care and preschool in the U.S. city average). \nNDCP data are intended to be used at the county level; caution is advised when using state averages. State averages are created by weighting county childcare price estimates by county population for counties with available childcare price data. Some states have more missing data than others which could impact the estimated state averages. \nAs a result, state averages may not meet the higher quality standards developed for the NDCP county-level estimates.
